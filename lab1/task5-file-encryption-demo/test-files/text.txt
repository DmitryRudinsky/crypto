The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric-key algorithm
for the encryption of digital data. Although its short key length
of 56 bits makes it too insecure for modern applications, it was
highly influential in the advancement of cryptography.

DES was developed in the early 1970s at IBM and based on an earlier
design by Horst Feistel. The algorithm was submitted to the National
Bureau of Standards (NBS) following the agency's invitation to propose
a candidate for the protection of sensitive, unclassified electronic
government data.
